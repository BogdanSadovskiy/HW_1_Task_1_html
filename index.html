        PROLOGUE
    </h3>
    <h5>
        Two households, both alike in dignity <br>
        (In fair Verona, where we lay our scene),<br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
        A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;<br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
        Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.<br>
        The fearful passage of their death-marked love<br>
        And the continuance of their parents’ rage,<br>
        Which, but their children’s end, naught could remove,<br>
        Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;<br>
        The which, if you with patient ears attend,<br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.<br>
